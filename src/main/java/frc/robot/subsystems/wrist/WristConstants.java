/*
The Magnet Encoder Offset represents the rotational offset of the absolute encoder in rotations (not degrees).
What does 0.16 mean?
The offset is given in rotations (where 1.0 = one full revolution = 360 degrees).
Your value of 0.16 means the encoder is offset by: 0.16 Ã— 360 = 57.6

This means that when the encoder reads "0", the actual position of the mechanism is 57.6 degrees ahead.
